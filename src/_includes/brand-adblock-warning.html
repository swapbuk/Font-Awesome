<h4><i class="fa fa-warning"></i> Warning!</h4>
Apparently, Adblock Plus automatically removes many Font Awesome brand icons with their "Remove Social
Media Buttons" feature. We will not use hacks to force them to display. Please
<a href="https://adblockplus.org/en/bugs" class="alert-link">report an issue with Adblock</a> if you believe this to be
an error. To work around this, you'll need to modify the social icon class names.
